# Where Is My Car App

Simple Qt Application project to save and get the location of your car on the map:

</p>

Simple but useful functions in case, like me, you don't have a modern car:
* Load map information from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/40.007/-2.488).
* Show your current location.
* Allow you to save your car location manually or setting it to your (device) current location.
